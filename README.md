# Alert-Notification-system

This is alert notification system project.
The project is about making alarm notifications to the user about the autombile they use.
It is all about alerting the user because of his/her automobile is in a condition that usually shouldn't be.
Like if the car is crossing overspeed or if the tyre pressure is less than lower limit it makes an alert.

It can be open in intellj or jde-eclipse platform.

Here the main program is in "Program" folder. We have to run the Program folder.
Rules are thing the company creates to control the autombiles which they follow the spireon company.

It triggers alarm if the automobile's data which come from the database they use(usually they use kafka) can satisfy the rule.
The automobiles data is in the "vehicledata event" .

This is all about we did the project in 2 1/2 months internship at spireon company.
